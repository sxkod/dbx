# dbx
An extremely simple database facility for game development in godot

- It is not the most efficient
- It doesn't have error tolerance or parsing
- It is very simplistic and will never be a grownup database facility
- It handles the floating points a bit better now!

Saying that, it can be used to maintain in-game data and use querying to get/set data.

Have fun
